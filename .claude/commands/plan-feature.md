Create a detailed implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:

1. Read relevant existing code
2. Read CLAUDE.md for constraints
3. Read SPEC.md for requirements
4. Create plan with:
   - Files to modify/create
   - Order of changes
   - Test strategy
   - Potential risks
5. Do NOT write code—only plan

Output the plan in a format I can review and iterate on.
